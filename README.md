# Quantum-Seeded Monte Carlo Platform on AWS

A serverless platform on AWS that prices a stock option by simulation, seeds every job from Qrypt quantum
randomness, and can replay any past job to the exact same answer. Everything is built with Terraform.

**Plain-language summary.** A *Monte Carlo* job estimates a number by simulating many random futures and
averaging them. Here the number is the fair price of a *European call option* (the right to buy a stock at a
set price on a set date). The *Black-Scholes* formula gives the exact answer for this option, so we can prove
the simulation is right. Each job gets its starting randomness (its *seed*) from Qrypt's quantum random
number service, splits into parallel pieces (*shards*), and stores everything needed to replay it later.

Coming with the build: `AI_USAGE.md`, `.env.example`, a grader quick-start in this README, and the cost note.

## Grader quick-start

Added once the build is done: configure AWS credentials, store the SSM parameters, `terraform apply`,
submit a job, replay it, `terraform destroy`.
